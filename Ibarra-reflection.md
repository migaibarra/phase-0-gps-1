**Answers to the GPS 1.1 Questions for Reflection**

* I was a bit unfamiliar with git merge conflicts, namely how they occur, what they look like, and why they are such a big issue.
* Understanding what git look like helped me understand what it is to look out for with regard to how to resolve them and also avoiding them in practice.
* I asked my guide more general Phase 0 topics such what is expected for mandatory pairing sessions, if I can do a mandatory pairing session that is out of sequential order for that week, and even if he recommended that I learn VIM in addition to Sublime as a code editor.
* I would say using git itself is not terribly difficult (luckily I did have some exposure to git beforehand through my roommate who is a web developer); however, I am curious as to how git actually works in the background interfacing with the web and having the ability to talk with GitHub to get a remote repository, etc. I know it must be very meta.
* It was pretty good. Unfortunately I was not able to pair with someone, but Matt Higgins still made it work and like he said, of all the GPS to work on just by yourself, this one was probably the one to do it in.
